/*
Algorithms: Find the Symmetric Difference
Create a function that takes two or more arrays and returns an array of the symmetric difference (△ or ⊕) of the provided arrays.

Given two sets (for example set A = {1, 2, 3} and set B = {2, 3, 4}), the mathematical term "symmetric difference" of two sets is the set of elements which are in either of the two sets, but not in both (A △ B = C = {1, 4}). For every additional symmetric difference you take (say on a set D = {2, 3}), you should get the set with elements which are in either of the two the sets but not both (C △ D = {1, 4} △ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3, 4}). The resulting array must contain only unique values (no duplicates).

function sym(...args) {
  //removing duplicates from each array
  args = args.map(item => [...new Set(item)]);
  //return intersection set of the two arrays
  const reducer = (acc, curr) => [
    ...acc.filter(item => !curr.includes(item)),
    ...curr.filter(item=> !acc.includes(item))
  ];
  let result = args.reduce(reducer);
  
  console.log(result);
  return result;
}

sym([1, 2, 3], [5, 2, 1, 4, 5]);
